# Agentic System

AI agent logic, automation, and intelligent task processing for SmartSpace.

## Responsibilities

- Agent orchestration and coordination
- Task evaluation and approval workflows
- Autonomous API request handling
- Integration with SmartSpace backend gateway
- Result processing and feedback loops
- Intelligent routing and decision making

## Status

🚧 **In Development** - This folder is ready for agentic system development.

## Planned Tech Stack

(To be determined by AI engineer)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to this directory:
```bash
cd agentic
```

2. Set up your development environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Configure environment variables
5. Run the agentic system

## Folder Structure

(To be created)
```
agentic/
├── src/
│   ├── agents/
│   ├── tasks/
│   ├── evaluators/
│   ├── integrations/

```

## Architecture

The agentic system integrates with:
- **Backend API** - For request processing and payment handling
- **External APIs** - Via SmartSpace gateway (never directly)
- **Payment System** - Through backend integration

## Agent Workflow

1. Receive task request
2. Evaluate task requirements and costs
3. Request approval/payment via backend
4. Execute API calls through SmartSpace gateway
5. Process results and provide feedback

## Development

More details coming soon as development progresses.
