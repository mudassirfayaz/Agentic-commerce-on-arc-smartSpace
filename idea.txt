Project Name:
SmartSpace — Autonomous Pay-Per-Use API Access with USDC

Concept:
A secure gateway that allows users and AI agents to call paid APIs (OpenAI, Google, Gemini, etc.) and pay instantly per request using USDC. Users do not need API keys and billing remains controlled, transparent, and predictable.

Problem:
• Shared API keys are risky
• Monthly billing is unpredictable
• Hard to track exact usage per request
• Difficult for finance teams to audit
• AI agents cannot safely make paid API calls autonomously

Solution:
SmartSpace becomes the secure billing and control layer:
1. User or agent requests a task
2. SmartSpace checks price and spending policies
3. SmartSpace pays the required amount in USDC instantly
4. SmartSpace calls the external API using secure internal keys
5. Result + full usage + payment log is returned

Who Uses It:
• AI startups
• Enterprise AI teams
• Agent-based systems
• SaaS platforms using AI APIs
• Developers wanting safe controlled API usage

Core Features (MVP):
• Create project or agent
• Set budgets and spending rules
• Per-request USDC payments
• Secure API execution
• Full usage + transaction logs
• No API key exposure

Architecture Flow:
User / Agent → SmartSpace evaluates + pays → SmartSpace calls API → Returns result + receipt

Why It Matters:
Provides secure, controlled, autonomous API usage with financial transparency and enterprise readiness.

Team Roles:
Backend Developer — Platform logic + API gateway
Web3 Developer — USDC payment integration
AI Engineer — Agent logic + automation
Frontend Developer — Dashboard + logs UI
Product / Pitch — Concept, flow, and presentation

MVP Delivery:
1. Dashboard
2. Task request and approval flow
3. USDC micro payment execution
4. API call execution
5. Result + receipt display
